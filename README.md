# Collab-Hub
CollabHub is a smart and modern influencer marketing platform that makes it easier for brands and content creators to connect and collaborate. Built using the MERN stack, it replaces the confusion of spreadsheets, scattered messages, and guesswork with one clean and organized system. The platform uses a special “CollabHub Score,” which studies important factors like a creator’s engagement rate, audience type, posting consistency, and overall performance. This score helps brands choose the right creators based on data instead of intuition. With CollabHub, small and medium businesses can run more effective and predictable influencer campaigns, while creators get a professional space to track deals, manage collaborations, and present their work confidently. Overall, the platform turns influencer marketing into a smooth, smart, and measurable process for everyone involved.
